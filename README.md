# Gas-Price-Scraper
Scrapes gas prices from google maps around a specified location and radius

HOW TO RUN:
  - Change the directory hardcoded in the createDriver method in gasprices.py to the directory of your driver. I have a chrome driver uploaded for convenience but you can download another driver from https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/ under Third Party Drivers, Bindings, and Plugins.
  - From your command line in the directory with gasprice-client.py run python3 gasprice-client.py
